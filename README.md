### 🔭 I’m currently working on

1. 📔 **Marwari Dictionary** [marwari.info](https://marwari.info/) ([Repo](https://github.com/madrecha/marwaridictionary)) 👉🏻 A place to learn the Indian languages of Marwari, Mewari, and Rajasthani with one-of-its-kind bilingual dictionary categorized by grammar, topics, and labels. 
   - This will be the successor to https://marwaridictionary.blogspot.com, our earlier project by my brother [@adarshmadrecha](https://github.com/adarshmadrecha) 
3. 🙏🏻 **Jain Aagam** [aagam.jainism.info](http://aagam.jainism.info/) ([Repo](https://github.com/jainism-portal/jainaagam/)) 👉🏻 Read Jain Aagam — the supreme sacred scriptures of Jainism religion — with millions of their aphormisms translated into English and Hindi.

Both the projects are based on Nuxt and are open source, and your contributions are more than welcome. ❤
